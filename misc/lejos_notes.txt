=====

The leJOS website has intructions, tutorials, and API documentation.

http://lejos.sourceforge.net/

You want the software for the NXT brick.


leJOS Firmware
--------------

In order to use leJOS, you need to replace the default lego firmware
on the NXT with the leJOS firmware.  How to do this depends on your
operating system.

The device needs to be in firmware update mode.  To do this, you need
to push the reset button on the top left of the back of the device
using a paperclip or something similar.  When in update mode, the
device will make a soft clicking noise while it waits for you to
reflash it.


Other Notes
-----------

Some useful notes about installing/using on linux:

Bluetooth is more convenient than plugging the robot into the cable
each time you make a change.


API
---

The api provided by leJOS is very easy to use.

  //create a new bump sensor on port 1
  TouchSensor bump = new TouchSensor(SensorPort.S1);

  if( bump.isPressed() ) { ... }

Other sensors are similar:

  UltrasonicSensor ultra = new UltrasonicSensor(SensorPort.S3);


For two-wheeled vehicles, the TachoPilot has many methods
that make it easy to control and steer different paths.

  //create new pilot.
  //arguments are wheel size, distance between wheels, and 
  //ports for left and right motors
  TachoPilot pilot = new TachoPilot(.56f, 1.18f, Motor.B, Motor.C);

  pilot.travel(distance);

  while( pilot.isMoving() ) {
    // check for sensors, etc.

    if( bump.isPressed() ) {
      pilot.stop();
    }
  }


Motors can also be controlled individually.

  Motor motor = new Motor(MotorPort.A);

  //rotate to angle
  motor.rotateTo(75);
